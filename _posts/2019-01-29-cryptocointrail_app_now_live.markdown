I'm happy to announce the release of my blockchain related app [CryptoCoinTrail](https://cryptocointrail.com/)! Being an avid fan of its technology, as well as the open source community around it, I felt it was time for me to make an application that kept track of the things that many crypto enthusiasts vie for.

If you're a forex trader then content managing some of the most important crypto coins on the market can be a real hassle. As you have to jump from site to site to keep track of price trends, conversion rates, and finding good estimations for crypto currency mining.

Knowing that I was pretty much over with continually having dozens of website tabs open in order to find all this data, I began working on an application that would track all of that relevant information for me in one minimalistic way.

Thus CryptoCoinTrail was born! This app is able to gather up to date information on 200 of the most trending coins with market price, volume trading, and market cap. It's also able to convert volumed amounts for any coin into USD, so you can check the overall net worth of what you currently own. I also made it capable of sharing an extremely accurate mining calculator for each coin with adjustable hash rates for those of you who are into GPU and ASIC hardware mining.

Last but certainly not least, I also formed a valuable chart trail for each coin that incorporates the methodology of [Fibonacci Retracement](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/091114/strategies-trading-fibonacci-retracements.asp). This is used by many technical traders to help identify strategic places for transactions to be placed with target prices or stop-losses.

This accurate data gathering is all possible by incorporating various APIs from the most well known big data companies in the crypto community, such as coinmarketcap and coingecko.

It's also run on a very light weight app built from the ground up in [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/), which is a concise framework based off of Ruby on Rails, but without the bloated dependency of multiple gems. It's extremely minimalistic, no unnecessary complexities. I also have it running on [Ngnix](https://www.nginx.com/) with [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/), which is a system for preparing and launching instances of Ruby for use with Rack-based applications, all in a convenient package.

Now that you've had me blabbering long enough why don't you checkout [CryptoCoinTrail](https://cryptocointrail.com/)? It's completely free to use! Just sign up and you're all set to go!

Here's a sample showcase of how to use the application if you'd like a quick tutorial:
